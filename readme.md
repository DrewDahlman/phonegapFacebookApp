# PHONEGAP FACEBOOK APP
This project serves as an example of how to create a Facebook application or functionality within Phonegap using ChildBrowser.

This app will remember your Facebook authentication and allow you to use the Graph API from your app.

I've created a blog post tutorial that goes into full detail.

PLEASE NOTE - This is for Phonegap versions 1.3< A cordova 1.6 release is in the works so sit tight for that. if you can't wait just update your child browser!
